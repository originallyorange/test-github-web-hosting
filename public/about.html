<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/My Favicon (complete).png" width="5%">

<p>I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software engineering, full-stack development,
  and AI. My technical experience includes working with frameworks such as Angular and Spring Boot, as well
  as developing projects that emphasize problem-solving, scalability, and clean design.</p>

<p>In addition to engineering, I bring extensive teaching experience across multiple programming languages
  and environments. Over the years, I have taught students of varying ages and skill levels, creating and
  leading curricula in areas such as Python, Java, web development, and robotics. I specialize in making
  complex technical concepts accessible, whether through afterschool programs, summer camps, or structured
  classroom settings.</p>

<p>I am motivated by opportunities where I can combine technical expertise with communication and leadership
  skills, contributing to projects that are both impactful and innovative.</p>
